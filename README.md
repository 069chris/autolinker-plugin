# Auto Link Plugin

This is a simple PLugin that Links words in your document to existing files.

## Example:
 If you have file called test.md and in another file you write something like "... this is a test file."
 The Plugin will change the text to "... this is a test [[file]]."
'
You can use the "Autolink all files" or "Autolink open file" cmd.
